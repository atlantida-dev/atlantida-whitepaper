_NOTE: This document is still under development. Please, check regularly for updates!_

## Annotation

The goal of the _**Atlantida**_ whitepaper is to provide an initial description for the investing blockchain ecosystem
and related components. To keep the text reasonably short, the document will mostly focus on unique defining qualities of the
ecosystem.

## Introduction

This document doesn't provide final information on all of the implementation details. Some of the components featured
down below may change in the development and testing process.

_**Atlantida**_ is a rating blockchain ecosystem of index investments into crypto assets, both for new and experienced
crypto market players. It can function as an investment adviser, which can help you adequately evaluate current
market situation for any given moment in time, from particular tokens to the crypto market in general, as well as
help you make a competent investing decision depending on the situation.

Some of _**Atlantida**_ ecosystem components may be helpful not only to crypto investors, but to other crypto projects,
providing public evaluation and audition of their own tokens to gain further trust from their clients.

The project was inspired by [_credit rating agencies_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_rating_agency) of the stock
market, as well as [_John Bogle's_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Bogle) index investment strategy.

## Brief component description

_**Atlantida**_ investment ecosystem consists of the following components:

- _**Atlantida Ratings**_ is a blockchain service which performs public evaluation and audition of tokens and their
  respective crypto projects. The resulting ratings are recorded and updated over time in blockchain networks via
  our own smart contracts, which guarantees transparent change history.

- _**Atlantida Indexes**_ is a blockchain service which compiles crypto indexes of varying reliability classes.
  Reliability classes are constructed by segmenting rating evaluations gained from _**Atlantida Ratings**_. Each
  such class consists of a crypto asset basket used to calculate a particular index. Due to such approach every user
  may choose an optimal investment strategy, taking into consideration their subjective risk tolerance level.

- _**Atlantida Strategies**_ is a service that compiles index investing strategies based on the crypto portfolio
  composition of a given user. Index investing strategies don't mean individual investment recommendations,
  they simply show divergences of users' crypto portfolios into one or the other direction from the
  indexes they track in _**Atlantida Indexes**_.

- _**Atlantida Analytics**_ allows to analyze index investment strategies from _**Atlantida Strategies**_.
  Those strategies' analysis is performed by backtesting â€” analyzing its efficiency based on market's data history.

- _**Atlantida Autopilot**_ automatically applies selected index strategies from _**Atlantida Strategies**_.
  Automatic application means balancing of crypto portfolios in real time, which allows saving user's time and
  minimize divergence from targeted crypto assets distribution, thus lowering the risks and raising potential profits.
  This service also simplifies investing process, allowing users to control their portfolios without direct interaction
  with crypto markets.

- _**Atlantida Funds**_ is a line of crypto tokens with stable investing profits, minimal possible volatility and
  correlation with traditional crypto assets. Correlation is the result of using the traditional crypto assets as
  collaterals, while stable investing profit and minimal possible volatility are the results of diversifying crypto
  assets according to _**Atlantida Indexes**_. By investing into _**Atlantida Funds**_ tokens users invest into indexes
  consisting of multiple crypto assets, which allows them to create diversified portfolios with less trouble and
  thus minimize their risks on the crypto market.

## Project tokenomics

### Coin use cases

- Public evaluation and new crypto projects audition payments.
- Payments for custom crypto index orders.
- _**Atlantida Strategies**_ subscripton fee.
- _**Atlantida Analytics**_ subscripton fee.
- _**Atlantida Autopilot**_ subscripton fee.
- One of the ways to get _**Atlantida Funds**_ tokens.

_**NOTE:** as the blockchain ecosystem expands, the coin will go beyond a mere payment system in the project
tokenomics. The possibility to use the coin as a payment instrument will be decided according to the local jurisdiction
of each particular user's country. In case of a ban on using cryptocurrencies as payment instruments the user may get
an alternative option for payment with fiat money according to coin's current exchange rate._
